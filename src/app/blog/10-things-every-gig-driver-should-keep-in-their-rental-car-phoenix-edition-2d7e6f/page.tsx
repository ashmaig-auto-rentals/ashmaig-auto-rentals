          <h2 id="heat-kit" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Heat-Ready Kit: Water, Electrolytes, Sun Protection
          </h2>
          <p>Phoenix heat is no joke—especially from late spring through early fall. Keep a dedicated heat kit so you can hydrate between runs, protect your skin, and keep the cabin cooler when you park. Sunscreen and a sunshade also help reduce fatigue during long shifts.</p>
<p>Store the kit where it’s easy to grab—door pocket or center console. If you’re bouncing between Tempe deliveries and Glendale stadium runs, you’ll be glad you can cool down quickly at each stop.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Refillable water bottles or a small gallon jug</li>
<li>Electrolyte packets or tablets</li>
<li>SPF 30+ sunscreen and SPF lip balm</li>
<li>Windshield sunshade and a cooling towel</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="mount-power" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Solid Phone Mount + Fast Charging Cables
          </h2>
          <p>Multi‑apping drains batteries fast. A dependable mount keeps navigation at eye level so you can stay hands‑free, and a high‑output charger prevents slow charging in the heat.</p>
<p>Tidy cables reduce distractions, especially when juggling Uber/Lyft pings with Uber Eats or DoorDash stacked orders across Midtown, Arcadia, or South Scottsdale.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Sturdy dash/vent mount that doesn’t block your view</li>
<li>Dual‑port 30W+ car charger</li>
<li>USB‑C, Lightning, and micro‑USB cables</li>
<li>Cable ties or clips to keep cords neat</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="delivery-bags" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Insulated Delivery Bags and a Trunk Organizer
          </h2>
          <p>Hot meals stay hot, cold items stay cold—and your tips often reflect that care. Keep separate bags for hot and cold, plus an organizer so Instacart items don’t roll around.</p>
<p>From Arcadia restaurant rows to Tempe student housing, a tidy trunk helps you deliver fast without spills or re‑sorting at the curb.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Two hot bags (pizza‑size and regular)</li>
<li>One cold/thermal bag for groceries</li>
<li>Collapsible trunk organizer</li>
<li>Non‑slip trunk mat</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="tire-tools" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Tire Care: Gauge, Portable Inflator, and Sealant
          </h2>
          <p>Heat, construction zones, and post‑monsoon debris can mess with tire pressure. A quick top‑off can save a detour—and your schedule—when you’re hopping between the 101, 202, and I‑17.</p>
<p>Event nights near Glendale/Westgate or construction near Downtown can kick up nails and screws. Check pressures in the cool morning for the most accurate reading.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Digital tire pressure gauge</li>
<li>Compact 12V inflator</li>
<li>Emergency tire sealant</li>
<li>Work gloves</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="dashcam-safety" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Dash Cam, Flashlight, and Reflective Safety Gear
          </h2>
          <p>A reliable dash cam can provide helpful context if something unexpected happens. A flashlight and safety vest make roadside moments safer when you need to check a tire or address a spill after dark.</p>
<p>Before mounting any camera or accessories, review your rental agreement and choose placements that don’t obstruct your view. Keep gear accessible for late‑night pickups in Old Town Scottsdale or early‑morning airport runs.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Front (and optional rear) dash cam</li>
<li>Bright LED flashlight or headlamp</li>
<li>Reflective safety vest</li>
<li>Foldable warning triangle</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="airport-essentials" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Sky Harbor Essentials: Printed Lot Map and Notes
          </h2>
          <p>Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX) has specific staging, queueing, and pickup areas—especially around Terminals 3 and 4. Keep a printed cheat sheet so you’re not fumbling with instructions while navigating signage.</p>
<p>Follow airport and app rules, use official lots, and avoid idling in neighborhoods. A few minutes of prep can turn airport time into smooth, stress‑light earnings.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Printed Sky Harbor staging and pickup notes</li>
<li>App screenshots of airport queue steps</li>
<li>Small notebook for terminal tips</li>
<li>Pen and highlighter</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="cleaning-kit" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Quick‑Clean Kit: Wipes, Trash Bags, and Deodorizer
          </h2>
          <p>Between hot burrito bowls and iced coffees, spills happen. A fast wipe keeps your interior guest‑ready for the next ride or handoff.</p>
<p>After bar rushes in Old Town or downtown concerts, a quick refresh can make the difference in ratings and repeat customers.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Disinfecting wipes and microfiber towels</li>
<li>Small trash bags for the door pocket</li>
<li>Odor‑neutral spray (non‑overpowering)</li>
<li>Lint roller</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="first-aid-comfort" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Mini First‑Aid and Comfort Pack
          </h2>
          <p>A simple kit helps you handle small issues without cutting a shift short. Keep it compact so it lives in the glove box without getting in the way.</p>
<p>On longer Mesa–Peoria routes, a quick snack and sanitizer can keep you steady and focused, especially when restrooms are scarce.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Bandages and basic pain reliever</li>
<li>Allergy tablets and hand sanitizer</li>
<li>Spare face masks</li>
<li>Snack bars and mints</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="power-backup" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Backup Power: Power Bank and Offline Maps
          </h2>
          <p>Backup power is your safety net if the car charger fails or you’re away from the vehicle on a long handoff. Offline maps help when service gets spotty or events pack the network near stadiums.</p>
<p>Save common drop‑offs around South Mountain, North Scottsdale, and Chandler so you can keep moving even if the signal dips.</p>
          <ul>
<li>10,000–20,000 mAh power bank</li>
<li>Second set of charging cables</li>
<li>Offline map downloaded for Phoenix metro</li>
<li>Portable hotspot or prepaid data option</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="local-cheatsheet" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Local Hotspot Cheat Sheet (Downtown, Tempe/ASU, Old Town, Westgate, Sky Harbor)
          </h2>
          <p>Print a one‑page cheat sheet with notes on hotspots, common pickup spots, and event timing. Add reminders for parking rules, apartment gate codes, and building quirks you learn on the job.</p>
<p>Update it weekly with major events, game days, and big concert nights. Always follow posted signs and platform rules—no loitering in restricted areas.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Downtown Phoenix: Convention Center and Footprint Center events; note one‑way streets and bus lanes.</li>
<li>Tempe/ASU: Mill Ave and campus housing; heavy pedestrian/bike traffic and frequent small orders.</li>
<li>Scottsdale/Old Town: Weekend late nights; know rideshare zones and be courteous around valet lanes.</li>
<li>Glendale/Westgate: Stadium/arena events; stick to designated pickup/drop areas and expect surgey exits.</li>
<li>Sky Harbor: Stage only in approved lots; follow terminal signage and app instructions closely.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="weather-ready" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Monsoon &amp; Dust: Microfiber, Glass Cleaner, and Small Umbrella
          </h2>
          <p>Summer monsoons and dust can hit fast. Clear windows and mirrors keep you safe when visibility changes between Scottsdale, Phoenix, and the East Valley.</p>
<p>A quick wipe at a gas station in Tempe or near Biltmore can restore visibility and keep you on schedule without a full stop.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Microfiber towels for sudden downpours</li>
<li>Streak‑free glass cleaner for dust</li>
<li>Compact umbrella or light rain jacket</li>
<li>Extra windshield washer fluid</li>
</ul>
