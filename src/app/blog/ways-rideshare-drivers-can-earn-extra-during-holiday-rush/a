            During November and December, most major apps roll out{" "}

            If you normally focus on{" "}

            are a perfect time to add food or grocery delivery — and vice

          <ul>
            <li>
              Do airport and hotel rides in the early morning, then switch to

            <li>
              Run Instacart or other grocery apps in the late afternoon as

            </li>
            <li>
              Switch back to rideshare at night when parties and events pick up.

          <p>
            Holiday season means more people traveling in and out of Phoenix

            <li>
              Pre-game and post-game rides near major stadiums and arenas.

          <p>
            Plan your positioning around flight times, event schedules, and

            <li>
              Drive a fuel-efficient sedan or hybrid that keeps gas costs low.

            <li>
              Enjoy included maintenance on approved rentals so you don&apos;t

          </h2>
          <p>
            During the holidays, people are often in a rush, stressed, or
            carrying gifts and groceries. Small touches can lead to{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">bigger tips and better ratings</span>
            :
          </p>

            <li>

              hotel rides.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a phone mount so navigation is smooth and you&apos;re not
              fumbling with your device.
            </li>
            <li>
              For delivery, use insulated bags so food arrives hot or cold as
              expected.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When you start with a{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">well-maintained rental</span> that
            already feels professional, it&apos;s much easier to create a

          <p>
            Sitting in a parking lot waiting for a single app to ping you is a
            fast way to waste time — especially during busy nights when another
            app might be booming. A simple multi-app strategy can help:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Keep 2–3 apps running (for example, Uber + DoorDash + Instacart).
            </li>
            <li>
              If one app is slow, prioritize the one showing better promos or
              consistent orders.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid overcommitting — decline overlapping offers that would make
              you late or stressed.
            </li>
          </ul>

            <li>
              Note which times, zones, and apps pay the best so you can repeat
