            Know the Tempe/ASU Closure Pattern
          </h2>
          <p>ASU game days reshape Tempe’s traffic grid. Instead of assuming your normal route will work, plan around temporary cones, barricades, and officer-only turns. The streets closest to Sun Devil Stadium shift from vehicle priority to pedestrian priority, and small delays compound fast if you’re trying to thread the needle on Mill Ave or Rural Rd.</p>
<p>Check Tempe’s event updates before you leave your driveway, keep AZ511 open in a second app slot, and be ready to reroute around University Dr or Rio Salado at a moment’s notice. A five-minute detour chosen early often beats twenty minutes idling in a closure funnel.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Expect rolling restrictions near Sun Devil Stadium and Desert Financial Arena, especially around Veterans Way, College Ave, Packard Dr, and stretches of University Dr and Rural Rd.</li>
<li>Mill Ave and Rio Salado Pkwy often see heavy pedestrian traffic; right-turn-only setups and barricades are common on game days.</li>
<li>Kickoff and final whistle bring peak officer-directed traffic; allow extra time for detours to or from Loop 202 and Loop 101.</li>
<li>Use City of Tempe event advisories, ASU’s game-day maps, and AZ511/Waze for live closures and lane reductions.</li>
<li>When in doubt, avoid the immediate stadium grid and set pickups just outside the cones with clear walking directions.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="staging-near-tempe" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Smart Staging Near Sun Devil Stadium (Without Getting Stuck)
          </h2>
          <p>Pick staging that lets you fan out fast. On the north edge, Tempe Marketplace keeps you close but not trapped; you can jump onto 202 or slide down Scottsdale Rd based on pings. On the west, Priest Dr and Center Pkwy approaches help you avoid the tightest Mill Ave knots while staying within a few minutes of campus rides.</p>
<p>On the south side, Apache Blvd stations like Dorsey/Apache and McClintock/Apache are ideal for clear meet-ups. Send riders a short note—“Meet at the light-rail station entrance on the south side of Apache”—and you’ll avoid endless loops around College Ave.</p>
          <ul>
<li>North side: Tempe Marketplace area off Rio Salado Pkwy (quick access to Loop 101/202 and short hops into campus by Scottsdale Rd/Packard Dr).</li>
<li>West side: Priest Dr &amp; Rio Salado business parks for controlled approaches to Veterans Way without diving into Mill Ave.</li>
<li>South side: McClintock Dr/Apache Blvd and Dorsey/Apache light-rail stations—legal curb space nearby and rider-friendly meeting points.</li>
<li>Southwest: Hardy Dr south of University Dr for quieter streets and quick east–west options on Broadway Rd.</li>
<li>Use designated lots or wide curb lanes; do not idle in bike lanes, bus stops, or driveways.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="best-routes" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Best Approaches and Drop-Off Tactics
          </h2>
          <p>Your goal is a clean, one-pass drop-off with a fast exit—not door-to-door in a barricade maze. Ask riders if they’re comfortable with a short walk from a clear curb on Apache or Scottsdale Rd. Most are fine with it, especially when you message them early.</p>
<p>If you must enter the core, have an exit plan ready: a right turn back to Broadway or a quick jog to 202 via Priest Dr. The fewer left turns near campus, the better.</p>
          <ul>
<li>From the north/east: Use Loop 202 to Scottsdale Rd or McClintock Dr and stage just outside barricades, then walk riders in.</li>
<li>From the west: Approach via Priest Dr or Center Pkwy instead of Mill Ave to reduce delay at officer-controlled turns.</li>
<li>From the south: Use Broadway Rd as a pressure-release instead of University Dr when closures stack up near Rural Rd.</li>
<li>Legal drop-offs at light-rail stations (Dorsey/Apache, McClintock/Apache, Price-101/Apache) limit backtracking and keep you moving.</li>
<li>Pre-set a safe, legal pin: “Meet at the southwest corner of [street/landmark]” to avoid last-second lane changes.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="surge-timing" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            When to Log On: Surge Timing Around ASU Events
          </h2>
          <p>Think in waves. The hour leading into kickoff can be busy with short-haul bar and hotel trips. As the game starts, the core area quiets, but you can still make money on the perimeter—airport runs, Old Town transfers, and food deliveries to watch parties.</p>
<p>After the final whistle, expect a surge as fans flood out, then a second bump as people regroup for Mill Ave or head to Scottsdale. Keep flexibility high: if your app shows long ETA penalties inside campus, slide a mile or two out and let the trips come to you.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Pre-game: Restaurant and bar demand builds in Downtown Tempe (Mill Ave/College Ave) as fans arrive and pregame.</li>
<li>Kickoff to halftime: Rides slow near the stadium but stay steady in surrounding neighborhoods and hotel corridors.</li>
<li>Halftime: Brief pops for quick errands and early departures—be nearby but not trapped.</li>
<li>Post-game: Multiple exit waves—first movers leave early, then the main surge, then a late-night bar/after-party bump.</li>
<li>If stadium traffic gridlocks, pivot to nearby pockets: North Tempe apartments, Scottsdale Rd hotels, or South Tempe neighborhoods.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="phoenix-alternates" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Profitable Alternates: Downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale/Old Town, and Glendale/Westgate
          </h2>
          <p>Tempe isn’t the only show in town. If the campus core is jammed or your ETA penalties climb, roll to Downtown Phoenix for arena traffic or Roosevelt Row dinner rush trips. These zones often move better while Tempe unwinds.</p>
<p>Old Town Scottsdale is a reliable play for late-night demand, while Glendale’s Westgate spikes predictably when shows end. Read the calendar, ride the waves, and avoid sitting in the wrong grid at the wrong time.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Downtown Phoenix: Footprint Center and Chase Field event nights stack demand; Roosevelt Row dinner service keeps trips short and frequent.</li>
<li>Scottsdale/Old Town: Pre- and post-game bar lines, hotel transfers, and valet stand pickups are steady and tip-friendly.</li>
<li>Glendale/Westgate: Concerts and sports nights at the Westgate Entertainment District create clean post-event waves that are easy to stage for.</li>
<li>Use Loop 101 for fast pivots between Tempe/ASU, Old Town, and Westgate without cutting through city arterials.</li>
<li>Watch event calendars; when Tempe locks up, a quick reposition can net more rides with less idling.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="sky-harbor-plays" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Sky Harbor Pivots Before and After the Game
          </h2>
          <p>When the campus grid clogs, the airport often keeps moving. The 44th St PHX Sky Train Station is a solid meet-up option—tell riders to hop the train for a faster handoff when terminal curbs are saturated.</p>
<p>From Tempe, SR-143 is your friend. It gets you into Sky Harbor quickly and back out to 202 or 101 without looping through Downtown Tempe traffic.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Use the 44th St PHX Sky Train Station for smoother pickups when terminals back up.</li>
<li>SR-143 and Loop 202 provide fast connections from Tempe/ASU to Sky Harbor without cutting through Mill Ave.</li>
<li>Terminal 3 and Terminal 4 can surge at odd times on game days—keep airport queue info open.</li>
<li>Pair airport runs with Arcadia/Biltmore or Scottsdale corridor trips to stay productive between waves.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="delivery-tactics" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Delivery App Tactics on Game Day
          </h2>
          <p>Game days boost delivery demand, but the wrong pickup spot can erase your earnings waiting for parking. Favor plazas with open lots and multiple restaurants so you can stack orders and keep moving.</p>
<p>Communicate clearly: “Heavy closures by the stadium—can we meet at the main entrance on Apache?” Most customers appreciate the heads-up and faster delivery.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Target clusters with easy parking: Tempe Marketplace, Mesa Riverview, and South Tempe corridors along Elliot Rd and Warner Rd.</li>
<li>Avoid campus garages and Mill Ave during peak; walking handoffs can be slow and parking enforcement is active.</li>
<li>Message customers early if access is restricted—offer a nearby curb or storefront meet point.</li>
<li>Batch smart: Pick zones where multiple national chains sit close together to reduce deadhead time.</li>
<li>Keep a small insulated bag for short bar-food runs around Mill Ave and Scottsdale Rd.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="post-game-exit" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Post-Game Exit Routes, Fuel, and Charging
          </h2>
          <p>The first minutes after the final whistle decide your next hour. Don’t chase pings through cones—exit cleanly via Priest Dr or Scottsdale Rd, refuel if needed, then return for the bar surge on Mill Ave or Old Town.</p>
<p>If you drive electric, plan your charge before the chaos. Top off during halftime or set a quick mid-surge stop near 202 to avoid range anxiety when the best trips pop.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Priest Dr to Loop 202 is a reliable escape west; Scottsdale Rd or McClintock Dr to 202 covers east/west pivots.</li>
<li>Use Broadway Rd or Apache Blvd to reset south of the core before re-entering for after-party runs.</li>
<li>Check HOV lanes on US-60 or Loop 101 when you’re carrying a passenger to skip slogging traffic.</li>
<li>Fuel up on Broadway/University corridors; avoid tight stations near Mill Ave immediately after the game.</li>
<li>EV drivers: Look for chargers around Tempe Marketplace, Scottsdale Waterfront, and major Downtown Phoenix garages.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="safety-compliance" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Safety, Compliance, and Customer Experience
          </h2>
          <p>Clean, predictable pickups earn better ratings—and keep you safer. The campus area is dense with scooters, bikes, and foot traffic. A 200-foot walk for the rider is worth it if it means a legal curb and a stress-free handoff.</p>
<p>Your professionalism under pressure sets you apart. Short messages, accurate ETAs, and calm navigation through closures turn hectic nights into repeat customers.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Follow officer directions and temporary signage; avoid mid-block U-turns and don’t stop in bike or transit lanes.</li>
<li>Use clear, legal meeting points; send a quick description and landmark to riders before you arrive.</li>
<li>Keep hazard lights brief and only when fully curbside; never double-park across live lanes.</li>
<li>Mind scooters and crosswalk-heavy areas near Mill Ave and College Ave—pedestrians have priority.</li>
<li>Stock water in hot months and keep a spare phone mount and charger to reduce fumbles under pressure.</li>
</ul>
