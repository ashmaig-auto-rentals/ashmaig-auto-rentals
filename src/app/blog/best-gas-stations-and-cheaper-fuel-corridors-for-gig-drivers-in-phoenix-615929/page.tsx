            When to Fuel vs When to Work
          </h2>
          <p>Your best fill-up time is when your apps go quiet. Many Phoenix drivers fuel up before sunrise or between late breakfast and early lunch to dodge pump lines and traffic.</p>
<p>Prices often jump near on-ramps and event venues when crowds appear. If you can, fuel a mile or two off the freeway and away from stadiums before the rush kicks in.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Fuel during your low-demand windows; early mornings are usually calmer and quicker.</li>
<li>Avoid refueling right off major freeway ramps during the evening commute.</li>
<li>Top off before scheduled surges, stadium events, or airport rushes.</li>
<li>Combine fuel stops with restroom, water, and ice restocks to cut dead time.</li>
<li>Track your own routes for consistent price patterns—build a personal short list.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="cheaper-corridors" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Phoenix Corridors That Tend to Price Lower
          </h2>
          <p>In Phoenix, distance from the ramp matters. Stations placed right at the exit or entrance often charge a convenience premium, while pumps a few blocks down the arterial tend to be lower.</p>
<p>Build a mental map of two or three options along each corridor you drive: a quick in-and-out for busy times, and a slightly farther but often cheaper station for slower hours.</p>
          <ul>
<li>I-10 West Valley: Tolleson and Avondale corridors west of 83rd Ave are often more competitive than central-city ramps.</li>
<li>US-60 Mesa: Arterials a few blocks off the freeway between Dobson and Gilbert can beat the on-ramp stations.</li>
<li>South Phoenix/Laveen: Baseline Rd and Southern Ave segments frequently post friendlier pricing than downtown-adjacent pumps.</li>
<li>I-17 North: Check options just off Deer Valley Rd and further north; many drivers see steadier pricing than midtown.</li>
<li>Loop 202 South Mountain: A short detour into neighborhood arterials can avoid premium freeway-edge prices.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="downtown-phoenix" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Downtown Phoenix: Quick, Safe Refuels Between Runs
          </h2>
          <p>Downtown Phoenix pumps near the arenas can spike with both prices and traffic. When working Roosevelt Row, the Government District, or Midtown, slide a bit west or east for faster, cheaper fills.</p>
<p>If you’re staging for lunch in the Roosevelt area, consider a quick run to 7th Ave or 24th St corridors, then get right back to the grid without circling.</p>
          <ul>
<li>7th Ave &amp; Buckeye Rd: Usually easier access than right by the stadiums.</li>
<li>16th St &amp; Thomas Rd: Multiple stations and decent traffic flow north of the core.</li>
<li>24th St &amp; McDowell Rd: Good east-side option when bouncing between Downtown and Sky Harbor.</li>
<li>Avoid pump stops near Footprint Center/Chase Field during events and postgame rush.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="tempe-asu" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Tempe/ASU: Student-Zone Strategies
          </h2>
          <p>Around campus, convenience pricing near the 101/202 interchanges can add up. A short jog to Broadway, University, or Southern Ave usually finds better rates without killing your acceptance rate.</p>
<p>If you deliver frequently in Tempe Marketplace, keep a membership-club option in mind on the I-10 side. Only detour if the discount outweighs the extra miles.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Priest Dr &amp; University Dr: Central, with multiple options and good access to 202/143.</li>
<li>Broadway Rd &amp; McClintock Dr: Often steadier pricing than right off the 101 or 202.</li>
<li>Elliot Rd &amp; I-10 (Tempe): Membership club fuel can pay off if you’re already nearby.</li>
<li>Leverage Fry’s Fuel Points if you shop there—use it when you’re on this side of town.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="scottsdale-old-town" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Scottsdale/Old Town: Beat the Convenience Premium
          </h2>
          <p>Old Town’s walkable core pushes up convenience pricing. Slide to 64th/Thomas or along McDowell to find better numbers, then hop right back into the bar-and-bite zones.</p>
<p>If you’re rotating through the Airpark lunch rush, time a fill near the 101 during a natural break rather than stopping mid-surge near Old Town.</p>
          <ul>
<li>64th St &amp; Thomas Rd: Good access when bouncing between Old Town and Arcadia.</li>
<li>McDowell Rd toward Papago: East–west options often beat Old Town core pricing.</li>
<li>Scottsdale Airpark/101: Membership clubs near Raintree/Thunderbird can pay off if you’re already in a lull.</li>
<li>Run south into Arcadia/44th St for wider station choices when Old Town is packed.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="glendale-westgate" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Glendale/Westgate: Game-Day Awareness
          </h2>
          <p>On event nights near State Farm Stadium and the Westgate Entertainment District, pumps get busy and traffic clogs exits. Fuel before doors open or drift a bit west during halftime for a quieter stop.</p>
<p>If your route takes you between West Valley suburbs, check Glendale, Camelback, and McDowell corridors—often steadier than the lots sitting right by the freeway.</p>
          <ul>
<li>91st Ave &amp; Glendale Ave: Consistent access near Westgate—watch event timing.</li>
<li>99th Ave &amp; Camelback Rd: Options west of the stadium can be calmer on game days.</li>
<li>Litchfield Park &amp; Goodyear: Stations along McDowell Rd often compete well.</li>
<li>Fuel before the Cardinals or concert surge; avoid post-event gridlock pricing.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="sky-harbor" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Sky Harbor Airport: Refuel Smart, Not Close
          </h2>
          <p>Airport-adjacent stations often price for convenience. If you’re headed to the rideshare lot, top off a few minutes away on 24th St, 44th St, or 40th St instead.</p>
<p>Keep a mental marker: refuel before joining the PHX queue. You’ll avoid detours when your ping hits.</p>
          <ul>
<li>24th St &amp; Buckeye Rd: Reliable east–west access without airport markup.</li>
<li>44th St &amp; McDowell Rd: Good for drivers bouncing between Arcadia and PHX.</li>
<li>40th St &amp; Broadway Rd: Southside option when staging for runs to Tempe or Chandler.</li>
<li>Avoid last-second fill-ups right at airport exits and rental-car corridors.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="loyalty-apps" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Loyalty, Apps, and Payment Tactics That Add Up
          </h2>
          <p>Pick one or two brands along your main corridors and lean into their loyalty programs. Consistency helps you capture recurring discounts without overthinking it.</p>
<p>Price apps are most useful when you’re already close. Let your route decide, not the cheapest dot on the map 15 minutes away.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Circle K Easy Pay, Shell Fuel Rewards, BPme—stack store programs where you fuel most.</li>
<li>Fry’s Fuel Points: Grocery runs can reduce per-gallon cost; plan redemptions near routes.</li>
<li>Upside and price-comparison apps help spot dips without chasing pennies across town.</li>
<li>Debit, ACH, or station-linked cards can avoid extra fees some pumps add to credit.</li>
<li>Keep digital receipts for taxes and mileage logs—every bit matters at year-end.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="vehicle-strategy" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Vehicle Choice, Range, and Fuel-Saving Habits
          </h2>
          <p>Small habits compound for gig drivers. Proper tire pressure, smooth acceleration, and smart batching can match the savings of a loyalty program without extra time.</p>
<p>If you rent, choose a trim known for efficiency and keep up with maintenance. That steadier MPG means fewer pump stops and more time on deliveries and rides.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Choose fuel‑efficient vehicles; compact and hybrid models stretch each stop.</li>
<li>Keep tires at door‑jamb PSI and rotate on schedule—underinflation burns fuel.</li>
<li>Drive smoothly: steady throttle, anticipate lights, and avoid hard launches.</li>
<li>Batch trips so your cheaper corridors line up with your meal or restroom breaks.</li>
<li>Lighten the load—remove unused gear; roof racks and clutter cost mileage.</li>
</ul>
