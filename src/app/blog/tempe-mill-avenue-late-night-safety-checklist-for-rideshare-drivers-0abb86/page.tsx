            Know Mill Ave’s Late-Night Rhythm
          </h2>
          <p>Mill Avenue feels different after dark. Sidewalks swell, riders move in groups, and curb space disappears fast. Having a mental map of your exits helps you avoid risky U-turns or last-second merges.</p>
<p>Watch for campus and sports calendars. ASU move-in, graduation, and big game days can turn routine pickups into gridlock. Build a few extra minutes into your ETAs during those windows.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Expect the heaviest foot traffic from late evening through bar close, especially Thursday–Saturday and ASU event weekends.</li>
<li>Crowds spike near the heart of Mill between University Dr and the bars north toward the lake.</li>
<li>Scooters, bikes, and jaywalkers are common at closing time—slow rolls and wide following gaps help.</li>
<li>Plan quick exits: University Dr, Rio Salado Pkwy, Scottsdale Rd, and Rural Rd are dependable escape routes.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="staging-pickups" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Clean Pickups: Staging on Side Streets and Curb Discipline
          </h2>
          <p>A one-minute reposition to a quieter curb can prevent honking chains and close calls. Message riders clearly: “I’m on the west side of Mill by the coffee shop—look for a silver sedan.”</p>
<p>If a rider asks you to stop in a bus lane or against traffic, redirect them to a safer spot. A short walk to a side street beats a citation or a fender bender.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Stage on calmer side streets off Mill (for example, Ash Ave or Maple-adjacent blocks) when curb space on Mill is saturated.</li>
<li>Confirm the pin and message riders a landmark before you enter congested lanes.</li>
<li>Avoid double-parking and blocking crosswalks; use hazard lights only where lawful and safe.</li>
<li>Keep your driver window cracked to hear rider names while keeping doors locked until you confirm.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="rider-screening" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Rider Screening and Boundaries
          </h2>
          <p>Late-night rides can be chatty and energetic. Keep it friendly but firm about rules: seatbelts, no vaping, no food mess. Clear expectations up front prevent conflicts later.</p>
<p>If you ever feel pressured to break a rule, keep your voice calm, explain your policy once, and offer to end the trip at a safe location. Your safety and license come first.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Match the name before unlocking and confirm destination out loud.</li>
<li>Seatbelts for every seat, every ride; do not exceed capacity.</li>
<li>No open containers in your vehicle; it’s not worth the risk.</li>
<li>If a rider seems unsafe or disrespectful, end the trip in a well-lit public spot and notify in-app support.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="gear-tech" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Night Gear That Works
          </h2>
          <p>Good equipment reduces stress when the street gets loud and unpredictable. A clear dashcam view can also streamline support claims.</p>
<p>Keep your interior lighting low-glare so you can verify rider faces without blinding yourself. Simple habits like pre-staging navigation and volume controls before pickup go a long way.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Dual-facing dashcam with reliable night vision and auto-save for incidents.</li>
<li>Solid phone mount within easy reach; keep cables tidy to avoid snags.</li>
<li>Small flashlight, compact first-aid kit, and a spill/cleanup kit in the trunk.</li>
<li>Tire gauge and portable inflator—curbs and potholes happen when curbs fill up.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="routing-escapes" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Smart Routing In and Out of Tempe/ASU
          </h2>
          <p>Your goal is two clean turns to an open curb, not a ten-minute crawl. If the pin drops into a choke point, suggest a safer corner a block or two away.</p>
<p>For longer trips, set your outbound route before rolling so you can focus on pedestrians and bikes during the first busy blocks.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Use Rio Salado Pkwy for east–west movement when University Dr is jammed.</li>
<li>Scottsdale Rd and Rural Rd are reliable north–south alternatives to hop toward the 202 or into Scottsdale.</li>
<li>When Mill is gridlocked, circle once, then pivot to a nearby rendezvous point rather than idling.</li>
<li>Pre-check event closures around Tempe Beach Park and Town Lake before you head in.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="valley-hotspots" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Valley Hotspots After Mill: Downtown Phoenix, Old Town Scottsdale, Westgate, and Sky Harbor
          </h2>
          <p>Mill Avenue feeds trips across the metro. Read the night: if Downtown Phoenix has a concert letting out, expect requests to tilt west; if Old Town is surging, you’ll see quick northbound hops.</p>
<p>Airport runs from Tempe are common at odd hours. Follow posted signs for rideshare at Sky Harbor and avoid waiting near terminals unless you are in an approved area.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Downtown Phoenix: Event nights can pull rides toward arenas and Roosevelt Row; expect late bar close waves and street closures.</li>
<li>Scottsdale/Old Town: High demand after Mill close; know the preferred pickup zones on side streets to avoid the main drag pileups.</li>
<li>Glendale/Westgate: Post-game crowds empty fast—plan your approach and exit routes around the stadium district.</li>
<li>Sky Harbor: Late flights and airline crew runs continue well past midnight; use the rideshare-designated pickup areas and cell phone lots.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="de-escalation" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            De-escalation and Incident Steps
          </h2>
          <p>Most tense moments dissolve with a steady voice and clear boundaries. Avoid debating policies; state them once and move to action.</p>
<p>Protect your account by logging details while they’re fresh and saving relevant video. Your future self will thank you.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Use a calm, even tone; avoid arguing. Offer solutions like a safer pickup spot or ending the trip at a public, well-lit location.</li>
<li>If behavior escalates, prioritize distance and visibility—gas stations or busy storefronts are your friend.</li>
<li>Document with your dashcam, mark the trip, and contact in-app support. Call 911 if you feel unsafe or witness a crime.</li>
<li>After any incident, take five minutes to decompress before accepting the next ride.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="earnings-strategy" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Earnings Without the Risk
          </h2>
          <p>A safe, smooth pickup is faster than a hazardous curb fight. You’ll complete more trips per hour when you avoid bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Plan your last hour: if you want airport runs, hover legally near approved waiting areas; if you prefer closeouts in Scottsdale, stage along the corridor leading north.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Do not chase surge into blocked streets; wait one block off the main drag where riders can reach you safely.</li>
<li>Stack trips that flow the same direction (Tempe to Old Town or to Downtown) to reduce dead miles.</li>
<li>Use destination preferences when you’re ready to wrap, steering toward home or a familiar late-night zone.</li>
<li>Schedule short breaks at bright, busy lots (Tempe Marketplace or major gas stations) to reset and hydrate.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="vehicle-readiness" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
