          <h2 id="peak-hours" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Peak hours around ASU Tempe during move-in
          </h2>
          <p>Move-in week at Tempe/ASU runs on predictable waves. Early hours favor airport pickups and hotel shuttles that spill over into Uber rides. Midday turns into supply runs, which is prime time for Instacart.</p>
<p>Expect another bump late afternoon as rooms need last-minute items. After sunset, students and families shift to Mill Ave for dinner, bringing short-trip Uber rides and small Instacart convenience orders. Keep your app filters flexible so you can pivot between ride and delivery quickly.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Mornings: airport and hotel to dorms for Uber; quick coffee and breakfast runs near Apache Blvd and Mill Ave.</li>
<li>Midday: Instacart dorm-setup orders (snacks, fans, bedding, cleaning supplies) spike as families unpack.</li>
<li>Late afternoon: multi-stop batches from big-box and home goods near Tempe Marketplace and along the Rural Rd corridor.</li>
<li>Evenings: Mill Ave dining rides and quick convenience orders; watch for short but steady surges.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="campus-pickups-tempe-asu" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Campus pickups: smooth Uber routing in Tempe
          </h2>
          <p>Construction and barricades shift during move-in week. Rather than forcing a curb stop on a coned lane, message riders with a simple template: “Meet on the corner of [Street A] and [Street B], passenger side curb.”</p>
<p>Garages and loading zones can be calmer if the rider agrees to meet you there. Always follow posted signs and campus traffic control, and keep your hazards on only when parked legally and safely.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Use clear cross streets like University Dr and College Ave or Apache Blvd and Rural Rd in pickup notes.</li>
<li>Avoid stopping in bike lanes or blocked curb zones; loop the block rather than risk a citation.</li>
<li>Ask riders to drop a pin by a landmark and text their building or hall name before you arrive.</li>
<li>If traffic is gridlocked, arrange a meet-up one block off Mill Ave or on a quieter side street.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="instacart-hotzones-tempe" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Instacart hot zones near campus
          </h2>
          <p>During move-in, families favor fast, familiar retailers. You will see a mix of grocery, pharmacy, and home goods. Dense plazas mean less deadheading between batches.</p>
<p>Keep your phone handy for gate codes and dorm delivery instructions. Alcohol orders do appear; follow all ID checks and handoff rules in the app. When in doubt, return the item per policy rather than risk a violation.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Tempe Marketplace area tends to cluster batches from multiple retailers with easy parking.</li>
<li>Broadway, Southern, and Rural Rd corridors often show steady grocery demand into late afternoon.</li>
<li>Prioritize smaller carts with lots of dorm essentials to reduce store time and speed up tips.</li>
<li>Use insulated bags for frozen items and message ETAs to win five-star ratings with students and parents.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="sky-harbor-arrivals" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Sky Harbor game plan for inbound students
          </h2>
          <p>Sky Harbor arrivals surge before lunch and again early evening. Keep communication concise and confirm terminal, door number, and luggage pieces to pick the right approach lane.</p>
<p>The cell phone lot is useful if you arrive too early. After pickup, choose the cleanest exit to Tempe via Loop 202 or surface streets depending on traffic. Smooth airport rides often lead to repeat trips as families bounce between hotels and campus.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Monitor Terminal 3 and 4 traffic and use the designated rideshare pickup zones.</li>
<li>If curb traffic stalls, consider meeting at the 44th St PHX Sky Train Station to reset congestion with rider approval.</li>
<li>Ask about luggage count before arrival to avoid re-queueing for space.</li>
<li>Use alternate surface streets like 44th St, Priest Dr, or Scottsdale Rd when freeways clog.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="scottsdale-old-town-nights" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Evenings in Scottsdale’s Old Town
          </h2>
          <p>When dinner crowds build in Old Town, position near the entertainment district but pull pickups to a calmer side street. This reduces cancellations and speeds your turnarounds.</p>
<p>For Instacart, evening orders often include beverages and last-minute toiletries. Be strict on ID and handoff; no ID means no delivery. Communicate politely and follow the app’s return flow if needed.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Expect short, frequent rides between Old Town Scottsdale and Tempe apartments as families celebrate move-in.</li>
<li>Use clear pickup points just off the busiest blocks to avoid double-parking.</li>
<li>Instacart alcohol and convenience orders can rise after dinner; verify IDs carefully and follow delivery steps.</li>
<li>Keep seat covers and cleanup supplies ready for late-night rides.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="downtown-phoenix-link" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Connecting with Downtown Phoenix demand
          </h2>
          <p>When Tempe quiets midday, Downtown Phoenix can bridge your earnings. Events and the ASU Downtown campus create steady trip volume and concentrated Instacart drop-offs.</p>
<p>Arrive 20–30 minutes before an event ends if you’re targeting outbound rides. For deliveries, check parking options or meet customers at the lobby to keep dwell time low.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Keep an eye on event schedules at Footprint Center and Chase Field to time pre- and post-event rides.</li>
<li>ASU Downtown students add ride and delivery demand around Roosevelt Row and along the light rail.</li>
<li>Use Washington and Jefferson as a one-way pair to avoid last-second lane changes.</li>
<li>High-rise deliveries: confirm elevator access and concierge procedures before shopping.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="glendale-westgate-backup" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            West Valley backup: Glendale and Westgate
          </h2>
          <p>Glendale’s Westgate Entertainment District is a reliable fallback when East Valley traffic stalls or surge peters out. You will find simple, quick trips and straightforward drop-offs.</p>
<p>Watch the event calendar for stadium activities that can spike rides. If you prefer to return east, use your destination filter to catch trips in that direction without going idle.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Families sometimes lodge near Westgate; short rides connect hotels, dining, and shopping.</li>
<li>Use Loop 101 to reposition quickly when Tempe demand dips.</li>
<li>Set a destination filter back toward Tempe if you want to drift east while staying active.</li>
<li>Suburban Instacart batches often have easier parking and faster handoffs.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="safety-compliance" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Safety, compliance, and campus etiquette
          </h2>
          <p>Move-in is hectic. A calm, by-the-book approach keeps you safe and prevents app violations. Clear messaging and legal curb use beat risky shortcuts every time.</p>
<p>Document tricky drop-offs with a quick photo when allowed by the app, and message customers with precise meet points. Professional conduct earns ratings and repeat business.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Do not block crosswalks, bike lanes, or fire lanes, even for quick pickups.</li>
<li>Follow all move-in traffic control signs and staff directions on and around campus.</li>
<li>For alcohol deliveries, scan IDs, confirm age, and never hand off to anyone underage or without valid ID.</li>
<li>Carry a basic kit: phone mount, charger, flashlight, reflective vest, and small first aid items.</li>
</ul>
