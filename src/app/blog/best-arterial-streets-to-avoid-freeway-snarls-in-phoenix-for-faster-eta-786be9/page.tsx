            When Freeways Jam, Arterials Win: Phoenix Peak‑Hour Patterns
          </h2>
          <p>Phoenix runs on a clean grid. When I‑10, I‑17, SR‑51, or the Loops clog, the surface arterials usually keep moving. As a rideshare or delivery driver, knowing two or three parallel streets for each freeway segment trims minutes off ETAs without taking risky shortcuts.</p>
<p>Expect slower pulses near major venues and campuses. Use the grid to slide one or two miles away from the freeway, then re‑enter near your drop zone. Keep your map app on live traffic, but build muscle memory for the arterials listed below—apps don’t always prioritize them.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Typical crunch times: weekday mornings and late afternoons; add buffers on Fridays and event nights.</li>
<li>Use 7th St/7th Ave as your I‑17/SR‑51 pressure relief through the central city.</li>
<li>Indian School, Thomas, McDowell, and Camelback are reliable east–west spines.</li>
<li>24th St, 32nd St, 40th St, and 44th St help you bypass the I‑10/SR‑51 interchange.</li>
<li>Northern, Bethany Home, Glendale, and Bell can outrun Loop 101 during slowdowns.</li>
<li>Baseline, Southern, Broadway, and University are strong connectors in the South/East Valley.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="downtown-phx" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Downtown Phoenix: Glide Around I‑10 and the Stack
          </h2>
          <p>Downtown Phoenix congestion spikes around the arena and ballpark on game nights and during conventions. Washington and Jefferson are one‑way with light‑rail in the center—watch for train priority and turn restrictions. For smoother flow, step north to Roosevelt or south to Buckeye.</p>
<p>If the Deck Park Tunnel (I‑10) is crawling, run 7th St or 7th Ave parallel, then cut across on McDowell, Thomas, or Roosevelt. For quick in‑and‑outs near Government, Arts, and Roosevelt Row, Central Ave and 3rd St/3rd Ave are dependable, with frequent turn pockets.</p>
          <ul>
<li>7th St (north–south) for east side access; 7th Ave for west side access.</li>
<li>Central Ave, 1st Ave/1st St, and 3rd Ave/3rd St for short hops to venues.</li>
<li>Roosevelt, Van Buren, Washington/Jefferson, and McDowell for east–west moves.</li>
<li>16th St and 19th Ave as outer bypasses when 7th St/7th Ave tighten.</li>
<li>Use Buchanan/Buckeye for industrial/commercial deliveries south of downtown.</li>
</ul>

            Sky Harbor Moves: Non‑Freeway Access and Quick Repositioning
          </h2>
          <p>Sky Harbor sits at the crossroads of I‑10, SR‑51, and SR‑143, which can stack up fast. Instead of forcing freeway merges, approach via 44th St/Washington or 24th St, then follow airport signage to the correct terminal route. For deliveries to airport hotels or cargo areas, Buckeye and University help you keep moving.</p>
<p>After a drop, 44th St launches you seamlessly into Arcadia, Old Town, or Tempe, while 24th St steers you toward Midtown and Biltmore. Respect designated curb zones and staging rules to avoid citations and downtime.</p>
          <ul>
<li>44th St/Washington is the airport’s most versatile approach and a fast pivot to Tempe/Old Town.</li>
<li>Use 24th St or 40th/44th St to bypass I‑10/SR‑143 tangles near the airport.</li>
<li>Buckeye Rd and University Dr are smart east–west resets south of the runways.</li>
<li>Follow posted TNC and commercial pickup rules—staging zones and wayfinding are enforced.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="tempe-asu" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Tempe/ASU: Mill, Rural, and Rio Salado Without Loop 202
          </h2>
          <p>Class changes and events around ASU bring sudden slowdowns and frequent crosswalk stops. When Loop 202 is jammed, run Rio Salado between Priest and Scottsdale Rd, or use University/Apache for east–west trips. For north–south, Rural and Mill are fastest off‑peak; during surges, slide to Priest/52nd or McClintock.</p>
<p>Watch for bike lanes, scooters, and special event closures downtown Tempe. If you’re repositioning to the airport, Priest/52nd to 44th St is typically calmer than the 202/143 combo.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Mill Ave and Rural Rd are the spine; expect pedestrian waves near campus.</li>
<li>Rio Salado Pkwy is a smooth river‑adjacent bypass between Priest and Scottsdale Rd.</li>
<li>Priest Dr/52nd St connects to the airport and South Tempe without using 202.</li>
<li>University Dr, Apache Blvd, and Broadway Rd are your dependable east–west bands.</li>
<li>Hardy Dr and McClintock Dr offer lower‑stress north–south alternates.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="scottsdale-old-town" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Old Town Scottsdale: Scottsdale Rd Isn’t Your Only Option
          </h2>
          <p>Scottsdale Rd gets saturated during dining hours, spring training, and weekend nights. Use Hayden to track north–south quickly, then cut in on Camelback or Indian School. From the west, 64th St or 68th St is often faster than forcing Scottsdale Rd.</p>
<p>For drop‑offs in the Entertainment District or near Scottsdale Stadium, use Goldwater or Drinkwater to circle in and out. Mind turn restrictions and one‑ways, and expect rideshare zones during big events.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Hayden Rd as a steady north–south just east of Old Town.</li>
<li>68th St/64th St/Invergordon for west‑side approaches from Arcadia and Biltmore.</li>
<li>Goldwater Blvd and Drinkwater Blvd loop the Old Town core for precise drops.</li>
<li>Indian School, Camelback, and Thomas are your primary east–west links.</li>
<li>Indian Bend and Chaparral help you bypass Camelback backups to the north.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="glendale-westgate" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Glendale &amp; Westgate: Beat Loop 101 Slowdowns on Event Nights
          </h2>
          <p>When the Loop 101 stalls before games or concerts, shift to 91st or 99th Ave and approach on Northern, Glendale, or Cardinals Way. This grid lets you slip around parking surges and reach hotel clusters or residential drop‑offs smoothly.</p>
<p>Plan exits before the event ends. Northern to 83rd/99th Ave often clears faster than waiting out the freeway ramps. Watch for officers directing traffic and temporary turn restrictions.</p>
          <ul>
<li>83rd Ave, 91st Ave, and 99th Ave run clean north–south near Westgate.</li>
<li>Glendale Ave, Northern Ave, and Bethany Home Rd/Cardinals Way for east–west access.</li>
<li>Camelback Rd is a strong cross‑valley workhorse south of the stadium.</li>
<li>Use McDowell or Buckeye west of I‑17 to reach 99th/107th Ave without I‑10.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="north-paradise" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            North Phoenix &amp; Paradise Valley: SR‑51/101 Workarounds
          </h2>
          <p>If SR‑51 or the 101 bottlenecks, Tatum moves you between North Phoenix, PV, and Scottsdale with predictable signals. East–west, Bell and Greenway carry volume well; for mid‑corridor moves, Thunderbird and Cactus are steadier than hopping on the freeway for short distances.</p>
<p>Expect strict speed enforcement and frequent left‑turn pockets near PV. Sun glare can be rough on east–west roads at sunrise and sunset—leave extra space and plan lane changes early.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Tatum Blvd is a reliable north–south anchor through Paradise Valley.</li>
<li>32nd St, 40th St, and 56th St/40th St corridors parallel SR‑51 without the merges.</li>
<li>Bell Rd, Greenway Rd, Thunderbird Rd, and Cactus Rd are consistent east–west routes.</li>
<li>Shea Blvd connects to Scottsdale/101 while avoiding freeway chokepoints.</li>
</ul>

            Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert: East–West Bands That Keep You Moving
          </h2>
          <p>When US‑60 clogs, stay on Baseline or Southern for longer stretches, then cut down on Alma School, Arizona Ave, or Gilbert Rd. In Chandler, Warner and Ray help you clear the Price Rd/tech corridor without entering Loop 101/202 tangles.</p>
<p>Railroad crossings and school zones can add quick delays—scan ahead for queues and pivot a mile north or south to the next arterial when you spot red blocks on your map.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Warner Rd, Ray Rd, and Chandler Blvd are efficient Chandler/Gilbert cross‑towns.</li>
<li>Guadalupe Rd, Baseline Rd, Southern Ave, and Broadway Rd span Tempe/Mesa well.</li>
<li>McClintock, Dobson, Alma School, Arizona Ave, Gilbert Rd, and Val Vista for north–south.</li>
<li>Power Rd, Higley Rd, and Stapley Dr as outer‑grid options when the 60 slows.</li>
</ul>

            Your Phoenix Arterial Playbook: Small Habits, Big ETA Gains
          </h2>
          <p>Arterials reward calm, consistent driving: fewer merges, predictable signals, and easier positioning for turns. Keep an eye on sun angle, construction notices, and school zone times. If your map app keeps pushing a jammed freeway, zoom out and pick the next parallel arterial for a cleaner run.</p>
<p>Build your own presets: save pins for hot zones in Downtown Phoenix, Tempe/ASU, Old Town, Westgate, and Sky Harbor. A five‑minute reposition on the right surface street often beats a tense freeway gamble.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Stay two lanes off the curb near bus stops to avoid frequent merges.</li>
<li>Know light‑rail streets (Washington/Jefferson, Central Ave/Mill Ave areas) and turn rules.</li>
<li>Use event calendars (sports, concerts, campus) to pre‑plan alternates.</li>
<li>Monsoon season: avoid low‑lying dips and fast‑filling curb lanes; dust can cut visibility fast.</li>
<li>Respect speed limits and photo‑enforced intersections—tickets erase any time saved.</li>
<li>Keep fuel and restock spots mapped on your favorite arterials to minimize dead time.</li>
</ul>
