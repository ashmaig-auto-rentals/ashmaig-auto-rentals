            Curbside etiquette that keeps traffic moving
          </h2>
          <p>Sky Harbor curb officers expect continuous flow. Treat the curb like a conveyor belt: glide in, load, and glide out. If a ping or text suggests your rider is still at baggage claim, do not dwell at the curb. Circle or wait off-terminus until they confirm they are physically outside at the rideshare area.</p>
<p>Use hazard lights only while actively loading. Be courteous to fellow drivers by pulling up to tighten the line, leaving crosswalks clear, and closing your trunk before you merge out.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Use active loading only. If your rider is not at the curb, keep moving or loop.</li>
<li>Pull forward to the next open space so cars behind you can file in.</li>
<li>Confirm the app zone and terminal before you enter the loop road.</li>
<li>Open the trunk promptly, load fast, and clear the lane.</li>
<li>Never double-park, block crosswalks, bus lanes, or the commercial shuttle curb.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="terminal-map" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Sky Harbor terminal map in words: Terminal 3 vs. Terminal 4
          </h2>
          <p>Think of Sky Harbor as a figure-eight of ramps and split decisions. As you approach on Sky Harbor Blvd, overhead signs direct you to Terminal 3 or Terminal 4. Choose early and stay committed to your lane to avoid last-second cuts.</p>
<p>Both terminals post large Ride Share signs near the arrivals level. The pickup areas are typically on the outermost curb, away from buses and shuttles. If you find yourself in a commercial or charter lane, continue forward and re-loop rather than forcing a merge.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Two active terminals: Terminal 3 and Terminal 4. Confirm which one in your app.</li>
<li>Arrivals are on the lower level; look for Ride Share signs to the designated outer curb.</li>
<li>Terminal splits happen early on Sky Harbor Blvd. Get in the correct lane before the fork.</li>
<li>Commercial curbs are separate from rideshare. Only use the signed Ride Share areas.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="pickup-playbook" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            A faster pickup playbook (step by step)
          </h2>
          <p>Short, friendly texts save minutes: &quot;I am 5 minutes out. Please head to arrivals Ride Share at your terminal and text your nearest sign.&quot; That single exchange avoids mis-queues and terminal mix-ups.</p>
<p>Once loaded, start the trip in-app, verify the destination, and let riders know your planned route. Clear communication reduces reroutes and keeps the curb humming.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Before arrival: message your rider to confirm terminal, airline, and that they are curbside.</li>
<li>Ask riders to share a door number or landmark sign if visible.</li>
<li>Watch for the app’s zone letters or pins and match them at the curb.</li>
<li>If the rider is not outside, use the loop or a legal waiting area; do not idle at the curb.</li>
<li>Load bags with the vehicle aligned parallel to the curb, then exit smoothly.</li>
<li>Confirm destination and preferred route before merging back into traffic.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="staging-and-cell" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Staging, cell phone lots, and looping without stress
          </h2>
          <p>Uber and Lyft typically require you to wait in a staging area until you are next in queue. Only proceed to the terminal once you have a confirmed pickup. This keeps curbs from clogging and protects your account.</p>
<p>Sky Harbor posts Cell Phone Lots for short waits. When in doubt, follow airport signage and curb officers. If traffic control diverts vehicles, comply and make another pass rather than stopping in a restricted lane.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Use your platform’s designated staging lot until you receive a request.</li>
<li>If your rider is delayed, head to a signed Cell Phone Lot or re-enter the loop later.</li>
<li>Looping is better than lingering. Lingering draws enforcement and blocks others.</li>
<li>Follow signs and staff directions over GPS if there is a conflict.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="app-setup" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            In-app settings and messages that save time at PHX
          </h2>
          <p>Templates reduce typing while you are focused on driving. A single clear instruction often turns a 10-minute hunt into a 2-minute pickup.</p>
<p>Be wary of last-minute pin drifts inside the terminal. Confirm the terminal by airline name in the chat and only proceed to the matching curb.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Create a saved message: &quot;Head to arrivals Ride Share at your terminal and text the nearest sign.&quot;</li>
<li>Enable share-trip or live ETA so riders know when to step outside.</li>
<li>Use pinned locations precisely; do not swap terminals based on a guess.</li>
<li>Favorite the airport Ride Share pins for faster navigation and fewer wrong turns.</li>
<li>If your app offers zone codes, confirm the rider sees the same code on the curb sign.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="metro-exits" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Fast exits to Downtown Phoenix, Tempe/ASU, Scottsdale/Old Town, Glendale/Westgate, and back to Sky Harbor
          </h2>
          <p>Leaving Sky Harbor efficiently is about early lane choice and clean merges. For Downtown Phoenix, favor the I-10 approach and exit near the central business district. For Tempe/ASU, the quickest moves typically involve Loop 202 or SR-143 connectors, setting you up for Mill Ave or Rural Rd.</p>
<p>To reach Scottsdale/Old Town, follow eastbound connectors and transition north before traffic tightens near the core. For Glendale/Westgate on event nights, expect heavier flows; plan a westbound route that positions you for a northbound loop without last-minute lane changes.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Downtown Phoenix: Use direct freeway access toward I-10 and the downtown street grid.</li>
<li>Tempe/ASU: Look for connectors toward Loop 202 or SR-143 to reach campus and Mill Ave quickly.</li>
<li>Scottsdale/Old Town: Head for Loop 202 east or northbound connectors to reach Scottsdale Rd/Goldwater.</li>
<li>Glendale/Westgate: Aim west via I-10 and then north via the Loop to reach the sports and entertainment district.</li>
<li>Back to Sky Harbor: Note your preferred return ramp so you are set up for the next airport run.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="special-pickups" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Special cases: families, ADA, groups, and luggage carts
          </h2>
          <p>Bigger parties and mobility needs do not have to slow the lane if you set expectations. A quick pre-arrival message about seat count and luggage keeps surprises to a minimum.</p>
<p>When space gets tight, prioritize safety and clarity. Keep doors within the curb line, announce when you are merging out, and verify everyone is buckled before departure.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Ask if a rider needs curbside assistance or extra time; load safely and promptly.</li>
<li>For ADA pickups, align closely to the curb cut, avoid blocking ramps, and keep space clear.</li>
<li>For groups, stage bags first, assign a quick load order, and confirm seat count before arrival.</li>
<li>If carts are involved, position so a companion can return the cart without stopping traffic.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="rush-weather" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Peak times, events, and desert weather realities
          </h2>
          <p>Phoenix traffic patterns flex around games, concerts, and weekend travel peaks. If you see unusually long curb queues, consider a second loop or coordinate a legal alternate meeting point.</p>
<p>During dust or thunderstorms, visibility can drop quickly. Give yourself extra space, reduce speed on the loop roads, and communicate delays to riders through the app.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Event nights near Downtown, Tempe/ASU, and Glendale/Westgate can back up airport exits.</li>
<li>Monsoon storms reduce visibility; slow down and expect sudden reroutes.</li>
<li>Summer heat is intense. Keep the cabin cool and bring water for yourself.</li>
<li>If police redirect traffic, follow instructions and re-loop rather than stopping.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="alt-pickup" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            When the curb jams: 44th St/Washington PHX Sky Train Station and Rental Car Center pickups
          </h2>
          <p>On gridlock days, some drivers coordinate legal, off-curb meetups at the 44th St/Washington PHX Sky Train Station. Riders ride the train from their terminal, you meet at the station’s pickup area, and you both avoid the tightest curb zones. Only use this strategy if it is permitted by your platform and agreed to by the rider.</p>
<p>If a ping is from the Rental Car Center, do not enter terminal loops. The facility is separate and well signed; meet at its designated pickup curb to avoid a long backtrack.</p>
          <ul>
<li>If allowed by your platform and the rider agrees, meet at 44th St/Washington PHX Sky Train Station.</li>
<li>Message clear directions: rider takes the free train from the terminal, you meet at the station pickup area.</li>
<li>For Rental Car Center requests, follow airport signs to that facility rather than the terminals.</li>
<li>Always confirm the exact meeting point in-app to comply with pickup rules.</li>
</ul>
