            First Friday peak hours and ride flow
          </h2>
          <p>First Friday builds in waves. Start with dinner pickups and quick passenger trips into Roosevelt Row, then pivot to short intra-downtown rides during the art walk. As galleries wind down, expect longer trips to nightlife zones beyond the core.</p>
<p>When big events overlap, the busiest windows extend later. Keep your tank and battery topped off before 6:00 pm so you’re ready for the push.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Pre-event food rush 4:30–7:00 pm from Midtown and Roosevelt Row kitchens.</li>
<li>Art walk core 6:00–10:00 pm with short hops inside Downtown Phoenix.</li>
<li>Late-night bar flow 10:00 pm–1:30 am toward Melrose, Arcadia, Old Town, and Tempe.</li>
<li>Weather shifts the curve—heat or rain moves demand earlier; watch app heat maps.</li>
<li>Same-night games or concerts stack demand—check Footprint Center and Chase Field schedules.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="street-closures-routing" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Street closures and smart routing in Downtown Phoenix
          </h2>
          <p>Expect rolling barricades and temporary no-parking signs near Roosevelt Row and Grand Ave. The grid helps—shift one or two blocks to find legal curb space without stopping in bike lanes.</p>
<p>Always obey posted restrictions and on-site officers. For the latest maps, check City of Phoenix Street Transportation updates and event organizers’ announcements the week of the event.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Roosevelt Row: Roosevelt St and side streets between about 1st Ave and 7th St often see barricades and lane reductions.</li>
<li>Grand Ave Arts District near 7th Ave and Van Buren runs slow with crosswalk crowds and pop-ups.</li>
<li>ASU Downtown blocks around Taylor St can have restricted curbs on event nights.</li>
<li>Use 3rd St, 5th St, 1st Ave, and 3rd Ave as relief routes; cross at Fillmore, McDowell, and Van Buren.</li>
<li>Set pickup one block off the closures and message riders the exact cross street.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="pickup-hot-zones" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Passenger hot zones and curbside strategy
          </h2>
          <p>Pin riders to a cross street that keeps you off the tightest blocks. A one-minute walk for them can save you ten minutes of gridlock.</p>
<p>Rotate between two or three preferred curbs and avoid stopping where cyclists filter through. Keep hazards brief and stay fully to the right when legal.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Roosevelt/Central light-rail station for meet-ups on the north or south side of Roosevelt.</li>
<li>The Churchill and monOrchid blocks—set pickup on Garfield or Portland to avoid Roosevelt congestion.</li>
<li>Crescent Ballroom area—stage on 1st Ave or Polk for smoother merges.</li>
<li>CityScape and Arizona Center—clearer curbs and predictable garage exits.</li>
<li>Footprint Center and Symphony Hall if concerts align; use the Jefferson/Washington couplet to circulate.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="delivery-plays" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Delivery plays that pay on First Friday
          </h2>
          <p>Restaurant lots get jammed; curbside handoff with clear messaging is faster and safer than circling. For stacked orders, deliver to the closest elevator bank first and keep proof-of-delivery photos tidy.</p>
<p>Apartment and condo drops spike near Hance Park, Roosevelt, and along Central. Verify access codes early to avoid idle time at gates.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Roosevelt Row and Garfield kitchens—use meet-at-entrance notes when dining rooms are packed.</li>
<li>Midtown Central Ave restaurants feed high-rises along Central and 3rd Ave.</li>
<li>Convention Center hotels—confirm bell desk rules before entering lobbies.</li>
<li>7th St and 7th Ave late-night eats—avoid center-lane turns; plan routes with fewer U-turns.</li>
<li>Organize insulated bags and stage cold items first for multi-stop runs.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="light-rail-and-hubs" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Leverage light rail timing and mobility hubs
          </h2>
          <p>Light rail compresses rider arrivals into short windows. Time your pass near stations a few minutes after scheduled stops to catch clusters without idling.</p>
<p>Give clear, friendly instructions in-app if the pin drops inside a closure. A reliable landmark reduces cancels and keeps ratings high.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Expect bursts after trains arrive at Roosevelt/Central, Van Buren/Central, and 3rd St/Washington.</li>
<li>If a rider’s street is closed, suggest they exit one stop early and walk a block.</li>
<li>ASU Downtown often restricts Taylor Mall—meet at 1st St and Taylor or Central and Fillmore.</li>
<li>When traffic locks, loop to 12th St/Washington or 3rd St/Jefferson to reset.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="beyond-downtown" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Spillover demand: Tempe/ASU, Old Town Scottsdale, Westgate, and Sky Harbor
          </h2>
          <p>When the art walk winds down in Downtown Phoenix, demand often shifts to Tempe/ASU and Old Town Scottsdale. If you land a long trip east, consider staying through bar close before returning.</p>
<p>On the west side, Westgate in Glendale can pop after headliners and fourth quarters. If you’re already near I-17 or Loop 101, it may be worth riding the wave rather than deadheading back downtown.</p>
<p>Sky Harbor can backfill the core with airport-to-downtown rides. Check queue length and only wait if the estimate fits your plan.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Tempe/ASU: Mill Ave and University Dr draw students after 10:00 pm—watch for campus events.</li>
<li>Scottsdale/Old Town: galleries and clubs surge late; stage along Drinkwater or Goldwater to avoid Scottsdale Rd.</li>
<li>Glendale/Westgate: game or concert nights bring post-9:30 pm bumps—plan your lane choice to Loop 101.</li>
<li>Sky Harbor (PHX): arrival waves can feed Downtown Phoenix trips; mind TNC queue times and re-entry rules.</li>
<li>Use Loop 202, SR-51, or I-10 based on live traffic to reposition efficiently.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="parking-staging" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Staging, refueling, and quick breaks
          </h2>
          <p>Tickets erase profits. If you must park, choose legal meters or garages instead of risky curb stands near barricades. A five-minute paid stop beats a citation.</p>
<p>Plan your fuel and restroom breaks before the 6:00–10:00 pm peak. For EVs, charge during early evening or after midnight when stalls are open.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Use legal metered spots south of Roosevelt near 1st St and 1st Ave when stepping out briefly.</li>
<li>Short-term paid options at Arizona Center or CityScape can be worth it to avoid tickets.</li>
<li>24-hour gas stations on 7th St and 7th Ave are dependable for restrooms; expect purchase requirements.</li>
<li>EV drivers: fast chargers in Midtown and near the airport help reset between waves.</li>
</ul>
      

          <h2 id="safety-etiquette" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Safety, compliance, and rider etiquette
          </h2>
          <p>A calm, precise pickup beats a curbside scramble. Communicate early, pull fully out of traffic, and protect cyclists’ right of way.</p>
<p>Compliance keeps you rolling all night—respect temporary signs, follow officer directions, and log issues through in-app support when needed.</p>
          <ul>
<li>Do not cross barricades or idle in bike lanes on Roosevelt, 1st St, or 3rd St.</li>
<li>Text riders a cross street and landmark—meet at the mural on 2nd St and Roosevelt is clearer than a pin in the crowd.</li>
<li>Keep doors closed until fully at the curb; scooters and bikes move fast.</li>
<li>For deliveries, confirm unit numbers and photograph door drops as required by the app.</li>
<li>Know airport and platform rules, including zero-tolerance policies and PHX pickup protocols.</li>
</ul>
